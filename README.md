They utilize various sales channels to reach their customers, including Offline Agent, Offline Direct, Online App, and Online Websites. The company offers a total of nine different policies. 

My task was to assist Shield Insurance in making data-driven decisions by analyzing their data from November 2022 to April 2023.

highlighting seasonal fluctuations.

## Recommendations

1. Promote Digital Sales Strategies:
Offline sales (₹703.65M) continue to outpace online sales (₹285.6M).
Enhance the user experience of mobile apps and provide special online savings.

2. Grow in High-Growth Cities:
Since they account for more than 80% of revenue, step up marketing initiatives in Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Delhi NCR.
Locate potential markets for growth that are comparable to these.

3. Target High-Value Age Groups:
Since they account for 55% of sales, concentrate your marketing efforts on the 31–40 and 41–50 age groups.
Offer specialized insurance coverage to the expanding number of customers aged 65 and beyond (₹193.77M).

4.Handle Seasonality in Customer Growth: 
Sales peaked in March and then declined in subsequent months. Put in place incentives for policy renewal or seasonal promotions.

5.Accelerate the Offline-to-Online Transition: 
Most clients favor offline representatives. Introduce hybrid models where transactions take place online for 
convenience but offline agents help with onboarding.
